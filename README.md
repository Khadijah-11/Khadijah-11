## 🌷 About Me  

Hi, I’m **Khadijah Tagui** — a curious builder exploring the calm but powerful world of  
**AI, Deep Learning, and Smart Automation**.  
I love crafting projects that blend intelligence, clarity, and a touch of softness.

Alongside my technical path, I also work as a  
**Virtual Assistant & Customer Support Officer**, where I sharpen my  
communication, workflow organization, and problem-solving skills —  
all of which fuel my transition into a **full AI/Data career**.

## ✨ Featured Projects  

Here are some of the projects that shaped my journey:

### 🖋️ **Handwritten Character Recognition (Deep Learning)**
Built and trained a CNN model for recognizing handwritten characters,  
including preprocessing, augmentation, and metrics evaluation.

### 🤖 **LLM-Powered RAG Chatbot**  
Designed a retrieval-augmented pipeline using document chunking + vector search  
to enable private document Q&A with a clean Streamlit interface.

### 🧠 **Brain Tumor Segmentation — nnU-Net (BraTS Dataset)**  
Performed preprocessing, training, and segmentation using a U-Net-based architecture.

### 🔧 **DRL Agent for Workflow Correction in n8n (PPO)**  
Created a reinforcement learning agent capable of detecting and correcting  
automation workflow errors — deployed with Streamlit.
