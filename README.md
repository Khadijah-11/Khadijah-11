## 🌷 About Me
I’m **Khadija Tagui**, a curious builder wandering the bright edges of  
**AI, Deep Learning, and Smart Automation** — crafting projects that blend  
intelligence, clarity, and a dash of softness.

Alongside my technical journey, I also work as a  
**Virtual Assistant & Customer Support Officer**, where I sharpen my  
communication, workflow organization, and problem-solving — all of which fuel  
my transition toward a **full AI/Data career**.
